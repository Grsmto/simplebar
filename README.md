##1. What it does

SimpleBar does only one thing : replace the browser's default scrollbars with a custom CSS-styled scrollbar without losing performance. Unlike most of others plugins, SimpleBar doesn't mimic scroll with Javascript, causing janks and strange scrolling behaviours...You keep the awesomeness of native scrolling...with a custom scrollbar!
Design your scrollbar like you want, with CSS, on all browsers.

SimpleBar works with jQuery.

##2. Usage
Via NPM:
`npm install --save simplebar`

Include jQuery and SimpleBar in your document. The paths and filenames may differ from those shown here:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/simplebar.css" />
    <script src="js/simplebar.min.js"></script>

###Via data attributes

You can get SimpleBar basic usage purely through the markup API without writing a single line of JavaScript.

Set `data-simplebar-direction="vertical"` on the element where you want your custom scrollbar. You're done.

###Via JavaScript

    $('#myElement').simplebar();

You will also have to add the `simplebar` class to the element : `<div id="myElement" class="simplebar">`

###Scroll orientation

Vertical is the default, but horizontal scrollbars are supported! Simply add `horizontal` class to your element when doing with JavaScript. Or use the value `horizontal` via data-attribute.

###Options

Options can be applied to the plugin during initialization:

    $('#myElement').simplebar({
      option1: value1,
      option2: value2
    });

Available options are:

####wrapContent

By default SimpleBar requires minimal markup. When initialized it will wrap a `simplebar-content`element in a div with the class `simplebar-scroll-content`. If you prefer to include this wrapper element directly in your markup you can switch the default behaviour off by setting the `wrapContent` option to `false`:

    $('#myElement').simplebar({ wrapContent: false });

Default value is `true`

####autoHide

By default SimpleBar automatically hides the scrollbar if the user is not scrolling (it emulates Mac OSX Lion's scrollbar). You can make the scrollbar always visible by setting the `autoHide` option to `false`:

    $('#myElement').simplebar({ autoHide: false });


Default value is `true`

You can also control the animation via CSS as it's a simple CSS opacity transition.

####css

It is possible to specify css classes to change the design of the scrollbar. To get your own styles to work refer to `simplebar.css` to get an idea how to setup your css.

- `container` represents the wrapper for the area scrolled by simplebar.
- `content` represents the wrapper for the content being scrolled.
- `scrollContent` represents the container containing elements being scrolled.
- `scrollbar` defines the style of the scrollbar with which the user can interact to scroll the content.
- `scrollbarTrack` styles the area surrounding the `scrollbar`.

```javascript
css: {
  // defaults
  container: 'simplebar',
  content: 'simplebar-content',
  scrollContent: 'simplebar-scroll-content',
  scrollbar: 'simplebar-scrollbar',
  scrollbarTrack: 'simplebar-track'
}
```

###Notifying the plugin of content changes

If you later dynamically modify your content, for instance changing its height or width, or adding or removing content, you should recalculate the scrollbars like so:

    $('#myElement').simplebar('recalculate');

###Subscribe to `scroll` event
You can subscribe to the `scroll` event just like you do with native scrolling element :

    $('#myElement').simplebar().on('scroll', function(...));

###Trigger programmatical scrolling
If you are using another plugins like jQuery.scrollTo or simply want to access to original scroll element, you can retrieve it via a getter :

    $('#myElement').simplebar('getScrollElement');

###Add content dynamically (ajax)
You can retrieve the element containing datas like this :

    $('#myElement').simplebar('getContentElement');

This is best to use this rather than querying it via DOM cause it avoids problem when the plugin is disabled (like on mobiles).

###Non-JS fallback

SimpleBar hides the browser's default scrollbars, which obviously is undesirable if the user has JavaScript disabled. To restore the browser's scrollbars you can include the following `noscript` element in your document's `head`:

    <noscript>
      <style>
        .simplebar, [data-simplebar-direction] {
          overflow: auto;
        }
      </style>
    </noscript>

##4. How it works

For the most part SimpleBar uses the browser's native scrolling functionality, but replaces the conventional scrollbar with a custom CSS-styled scrollbar. The plugin listens for scroll events and redraws the custom scrollbar accordingly.

Key to this technique is hiding the native browser scrollbar. The scrollable element is made slightly wider/taller than its containing element, effectively hiding the scrollbar from view.

##5. Limitations

SimpleBar can currently handle vertical or horizontal scrollbars, but not both simultaneously.

##6. Browsers support

Simplebar is supported and has been tested pretty much everywhere, including IE6+.

###Mobile support
Most of the mobile browsers have "floating" scrollbars. Also, they are not all currently supporting hardware acceleration on `overflow: auto` elements. So we decided to automatically disable SimpleBar when a "floating" scrollbar is detected. So mobile browsers will use native scrollbar seemlessly.
For example you will notice that it will use native scrollbar on mac OSX 10.8+ (when using trackpad) as the scrollbar is natively floating.

##7. Credits

This project was forked from [Adrien Grsmto](https://github.com/Grsmto) because I've decided to continue on v.1 branch. See Changelog for details. Below are the original credits.

Most of the credit goes to [Jonathan Nicol](http://www.f6design.com/) who made the original plugin called [Trackpad Scroll Emulator](https://github.com/jnicol/trackpad-scroll-emulator).

Credit is also due to Jonathan Sharp, who wrote the original function for measuring the width of the browser's scrollbar (http://jdsharp.us/jQuery/minute/calculate-scrollbar-width.php).
